# GEP
In this repository contains few testcases to familiarize with 
Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), Evolutionary Computation (EC), 
Genetic Programming (GP), Gene Expression Programming (GEP).

In particular, in order to explore several features and issues,
different applications are considered, such as:

 - hyperparameters tuning and features selection
 - regression of chemical reaction rates
 - regression of chemical relaxations terms
 - regression of multi-temperature transport coefficients
 - regression of state-to-state transport coefficients
